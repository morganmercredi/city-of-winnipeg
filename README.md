# Data Exploration Scripts

This repository contains a few Python scripts with some data analysis that I've done recently. Datasets were taken from the City of Winnipeg Open Data Portal. 

The City of Winnipeg Open Data Portal can be found at:

Looking back, I would've rather saved them as Jupyter Notebooks, but I never intended to put them online in the first place.
